My FED assignment


This project is about a more affordable option for fast food. It is an online fast food chain where the food is purchased by the customer and then it is delivered to their house. By creating this website, I hope to make it more convenient and a cheaper way for people to get more affordable food easily, since there is no outlets, there is no incursion of extra costs.

Design process

This website target audience is to all fast food lovers, young or old. In this website, i want it to be easily navigatable, so i made sure that the website contains all the essential elements like buttons that can help easily redirect to the page, and to make sure that it does not create new tabs to prevent confusion among customers on which tab they were in if they had to return to the tab they want.


I used lots of pixelated fonts, and multiple bit fonts so that it can portray more of an online vibe and easygoing restaurant, also mainly for the user sight

Features
HomePage:
    Display the promo code and Menu & Order and View cart and the promotions. Promotions displayed in a column list
    Promo code display will output either a discount received or invalid code prompt when clicked on Apply button using javascript : Promo Code is "budgetBurgerz123. The only button that works is the "Menu & Order" 

OffersPage:
    Displays the following items, its pricing and add to cart button, inactive buttons. The navigation bar option for "orders" is shaded grey to make it easier for users to identify the page they are currently in. It has a sticky navbar in case they are to scroll down and need to renavigate to different pagesCart 

Order Meal Page:
    This is the page after the user clicks on the "Order & Menu" option in the HomePage, which will redirect the user to this page. For this page I have added 2 different selections,
    - Budget Burgers 
    - Budget Set meals
    Which are also inactive buttons. The menu have been shaded grey as well for easy identification. The two selections options also show the types of food content inside the burgers such as 
    Fish and Pork. 

    I have also added the Go Back Page, which will redirect the users back to the home page in case they want to cancel their orderings. There are 2 buttons
    -Track Order -active button
    -Cart -inactive button

    Cart is an inactive button, with its intended purpose is to help customers view their orders, similar layout display as the offersPage. 
    Track order is an active button which will redirect the user to the OrderTracking page if the user has already placed an order and have did the payment

OrderTracking:
    This page is directed to the user after they have clicked onto the Track Order button from the Order Meal Page. This page will show the status of the delivery if they have already placed and order and checkout. There is icons to show the status of the food. The default icon is the time buffering.png, if the order has yet to reach to that stage such as "delivered already". Order status will also display the estimated delivery time, and two extra buttons 

    -Request Refund: Inactive button, intended purpose is for the user to get back a refund 
    -Order received: When the delivery is completed and the user has clicked order received, only then will their money be send out to the company. If the users would like to go back to the pages where they came from, they can use the sticky navigation bar on top

Contact Us Page: 
    For the final page, it is the contact us page, where users can contact us for inquiries or complains through 3 different platforms, WhatsApp, Instagram and Tiktok. At the same time there is 2 inactive buttons
    - Report : Users can report any technical problems or flaws on the website through a click of a button
    - Suggestions: Otherwise users can also add suggestions on how to improve the website as a whole. 

    If the user wishes to navigate back to the page, they can click on any of the headers in the navigation bar
